## Stack Kata

Uncle Bob's [Stack Kata](http://cleancoders.com/episode/clean-code-episode-4-sc-1-stack/show) from [cleancoders.com](http://cleancoders.com/).

## Steps

* newly created stacks should be empty
* after one push stack size should be one
* after one push and one pop should be empty
* when pushed past limit stack overflows
* when empty stack popped should throw underflow
* when one is pushed one is popped
* when one and two are pushed two and one are popped
* when creating stack with negative size should throw illegal capacity
* when creating stack with zero capacity any push should overflow
* when one is pushed one is on top
* when stack is empty top throws empty
* with zero capacity stack top throws empty
* given stack with 1, 2 pushed find 1 and 2
* given stack with no 2, find should return nil
