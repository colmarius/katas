## Anagrams "Kata"

[Kata06: Anagrams](http://codekata.com/kata/kata06-anagrams/) from Dave Thomas.

#### Kata Objectives

Apart from having some fun with words, this kata should make you think somewhat about algorithms. The simplest algorithms to find all the anagram combinations may take inordinate amounts of time to do the job. Working though alternatives should help bring the time down by orders of magnitude. To give you a possible point of comparison, I hacked a solution together in 25 lines of Ruby. It runs on this wordlist in 1.8s on a 1.7GHz i7. Itâ€™s also an interesting exercise in testing: can you write unit tests to verify that your code is working correctly before setting it to work on the full dictionary.
